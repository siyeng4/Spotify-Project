# Spotify-Project

Personal Project predicting song popularity on spotify.

# Project Overview

I will be analyzing Spotify data from a dataset on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zaheenhamidani/ultimate-spotify-tracks-db). This dataset was made using Spotify's web API. This Dataset has many variables that describe the songs such as popularity,genre,duration, key, mode, time signature,acoustiness,danceablity,energy,instumentalness,liveness,speechiness,valence, and tempo. These variables will be described in further detail later. The goal of the project is to see what features affect the popularity of a song on spotify. This information would be useful for a music producer or artist who wants to see how to make a hit song.
